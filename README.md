# OpenAI Agents SDK - Decoded: Expert Learning Modules

Welcome to the `decoded` sprint! This collection of modules is designed as an **expert-level educational resource** for mastering the **OpenAI Agents SDK**. The idea is to provide a deep, practical understanding of the SDK's capabilities, preparing you for advanced development and technical assessments.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The `decoded` directory breaks down the OpenAI Agents SDK into focused, digestible learning units. Each subdirectory (e.g., `01_agent`, `05_tools`, `13_models`) represents a core concept or feature of the SDK. This modular approach allows for:

1.  **Deep Understanding**: Each module concentrates on a specific topic, enabling thorough exploration and mastery.
2.  **Expert Assessment Readiness**: The structure is ideal for preparing for in-depth technical questioning, as each concept is self-contained and clearly explained with practical examples.
3.  **Progressive Learning**: Modules are designed to build upon each other, guiding you from foundational knowledge to advanced patterns and production considerations.
4.  **Practical Application**: Code examples are runnable and demonstrate real-world usage patterns.
5.  **DACA Framework Alignment**: The concepts and patterns explored here are foundational for building scalable, resilient, and cost-efficient agentic systems as envisioned by the **Dapr Agentic Cloud Ascent (DACA)** design pattern.

## ðŸ“š Structure

The `decoded` directory is organized into subdirectories, each representing a specific module or topic within the OpenAI Agents SDK. For example:

-   `01_agent/`: Covers the basics of Agent creation and core attributes.
-   `02_runner/`: Explains how to execute agents and manage their lifecycle.
-   `03_results/`: Details how to handle and interpret agent results.
-   `04_stream/`: Focuses on streaming responses from agents.
-   `05_tools/`: Explores the integration and usage of tools with agents.
-   `06_hands_off/`: Covers autonomous agent execution.
-   `07_lifecycle/`: Dives into agent lifecycle events and hooks.
-   `08_exceptions/`: Teaches error handling and exception management.
-   `09_guardrails/`: Discusses implementing safety and ethical considerations.
-   `10_multiple_agents/`: Explores patterns for orchestrating multiple agents.
-   `11_configurations_visualizations/`: (Assumed) Focuses on advanced configurations and visualizing agent behavior.
-   `12_tracing/`: (Assumed) Covers tracing and observability for agent interactions.
-   `13_models/`: Provides a deep dive into model selection, configuration, multi-provider integration (including LiteLLM), and cost optimization strategies. This module itself contains sub-modules for granular learning (e.g., `01_default_models.py`, `06_models_quiz.py`).

Each module typically contains:

-   **Python files (`.py`)**: Self-contained scripts demonstrating specific concepts. These often include print statements for educational output.
-   **README.md**: A dedicated README explaining the module's focus, learning objectives, key concepts, and how to run the examples.
-   **Quiz files** (in some modules like `13_models`): To test understanding and readiness.

## ðŸ’¡ How to Use

1.  **Navigate to a module**: `cd` into a specific subdirectory (e.g., `cd 13_models`).
2.  **Read the Module README**: Understand the learning objectives and concepts covered.
3.  **Run the Examples**: Execute the Python files (e.g., `python 01_default_models.py`) to see the concepts in action.
4.  **Take the Quizzes**: If available, run the quiz script to assess your understanding.
5.  **Connect to DACA**: Reflect on how these SDK features can be leveraged within the DACA pattern for building large-scale agentic applications.

## ðŸš€ Vision: Agentia World via DACA

The knowledge gained from these modules is crucial for realizing the core logic for creating **Software Agents for Business Operations** a global network of interconnected AI agents. 

With this the DACA framework will provide the blueprint for building the infrastructure to support such a vision, and mastering the OpenAI Agents SDK through these `decoded` modules is a key step in that journey.
