01_default_tracing.py

This module covers the fundamental concept of default tracing behavior in the OpenAI Agents SDK.
Focus: Understanding that tracing is enabled by default and basic trace vs span relationships.

Learning Objectives:
- Understand default tracing behavior (enabled automatically)
- Learn the difference between traces and spans
- See how traces are automatically generated
- Understand trace IDs and basic structure

Key Concepts:
- Default tracing is ON by default
- Traces = complete workflows  
- Spans = individual operations within traces
- Automatic trace generation with no configuration needed

Based on: https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/tracing/
