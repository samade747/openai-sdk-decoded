    1. Custom Tool Names:
       - 'get_technical_help' is more descriptive than 'transfer_to_technical_agent'
       - Better LLM understanding of when to use each handoff
    
    2. Custom Descriptions:
       - Provide specific guidance on when to use each handoff
       - Help LLM make better transfer decisions
    
    3. Callbacks (on_handoff):
       - Execute custom logic when handoffs occur
       - Log events, update systems, send notifications
       - Prepare context for receiving agent
    
    4. Multiple Handoffs to Same Agent:
       - Different contexts (escalation vs normal transfer)
       - Different triggers and behaviors
       - Flexible routing based on situation
