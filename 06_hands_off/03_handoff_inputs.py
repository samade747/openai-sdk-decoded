    1. Data Consistency:
       - Ensures all relevant information is captured
       - Standardizes data format across handoffs
       - Reduces information loss during transfers
    
    2. Validation:
       - Pydantic models validate input data
       - Catch missing or invalid information early
       - Ensure data quality for receiving agents
    
    3. Processing Automation:
       - Callbacks can automatically process structured data
       - Create tickets, update systems, send notifications
       - Prepare context for receiving agents
    
    4. Analytics and Reporting:
       - Structured data enables better analytics
       - Track escalation reasons, issue types, priorities
       - Measure handoff effectiveness and outcomes
    
    5. Agent Context:
       - Receiving agents get rich, structured context
       - Better understanding of customer situation
       - More effective problem resolution
