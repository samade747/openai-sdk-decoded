02_code_orchestrated_agents.py

This module demonstrates code-orchestrated multi-agent systems where the flow
of agents is determined by code rather than LLM decisions. This provides more
deterministic, predictable, and cost-effective orchestration patterns.

Key Concepts:
- Structured outputs for decision making
- Agent chaining and sequential workflows
- Parallel agent execution with asyncio
- While loops with evaluator agents
- Deterministic orchestration patterns
