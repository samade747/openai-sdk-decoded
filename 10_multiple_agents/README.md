# 10_multiple_agents - OpenAI Agents SDK Multi-Agent Orchestration

This directory contains comprehensive examples of multi-agent orchestration patterns in the OpenAI Agents SDK. Learn how to coordinate multiple AI agents to solve complex tasks through intelligent planning and systematic execution.

## üìñ Core Concepts

### What is Multi-Agent Orchestration?

Multi-agent orchestration refers to coordinating the flow of agents in your application - determining which agents run, in what order, and how they decide what happens next. This enables you to build sophisticated AI systems that can handle complex, multi-faceted tasks.

### Two Main Orchestration Approaches

Based on the [OpenAI Agents SDK documentation](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/multi_agent/), there are two primary orchestration strategies:

1. **ü§ñ LLM Orchestration** - Intelligence-driven decision making
2. **‚öôÔ∏è Code Orchestration** - Deterministic programmatic control

## ü§ñ LLM Orchestration (Intelligence-Driven)

### Overview

LLM orchestration allows agents to autonomously plan, reason, and decide on execution steps using AI intelligence. The LLM acts as an intelligent coordinator that can adapt to changing requirements.

### Key Features

-   **Autonomous Planning**: LLM decides which tools to use and when
-   **Dynamic Handoffs**: Intelligent delegation to specialized agents
-   **Adaptive Reasoning**: Handles ambiguous and open-ended tasks
-   **Self-Correction**: Can critique and improve its own work

### Best For

-   ‚úÖ Open-ended and creative tasks
-   ‚úÖ Strategic planning and complex reasoning
-   ‚úÖ Tasks requiring domain expertise judgment
-   ‚úÖ Scenarios with ambiguous requirements

### Example Pattern

```python
# Autonomous research orchestrator
research_orchestrator = Agent(
    name="ResearchOrchestrator",
    instructions="""
    You are an intelligent research orchestrator. Plan and execute
    complex research tasks autonomously using available tools and
    delegating to specialized agents.
    """,
    tools=[web_search, file_search, execute_code],
    handoffs=[
        Handoff(target=writing_agent),
        Handoff(target=planning_agent),
        Handoff(target=data_analyst_agent)
    ]
)

# Let the LLM autonomously orchestrate
result = await Runner.run(research_orchestrator, complex_task, max_turns=8)
```

### Key Tactics for LLM Orchestration

1. **Invest in good prompts** - Clearly explain available tools and capabilities
2. **Monitor and iterate** - Track where things go wrong and improve prompts
3. **Enable introspection** - Let agents critique and improve their own work
4. **Use specialized agents** - Domain experts > general-purpose agents
5. **Implement evals** - Measure and improve agent performance over time

## ‚öôÔ∏è Code Orchestration (Deterministic)

### Overview

Code orchestration uses programmatic logic to control agent flow, providing deterministic, predictable execution with better performance and cost control.

### Key Features

-   **Structured Outputs**: Use Pydantic models for decision making
-   **Sequential Chaining**: Transform output of one agent into input of next
-   **Parallel Execution**: Run independent tasks concurrently with `asyncio.gather`
-   **Iterative Loops**: Quality-driven improvement with evaluator agents

### Best For

-   ‚úÖ Predictable, well-defined workflows
-   ‚úÖ Performance and cost-critical applications
-   ‚úÖ Tasks that can be decomposed systematically
-   ‚úÖ High-volume processing scenarios

### Example Patterns

#### 1. Structured Routing

```python
# Classify task to route to appropriate specialist
classification_result = await Runner.run(task_classifier, task)
classification = classification_result.final_output_as(TaskClassification)

# Route based on classification
if classification.category == TaskCategory.RESEARCH:
    agent = research_agent
elif classification.category == TaskCategory.WRITING:
    agent = writing_agent
# ... etc

result = await Runner.run(agent, task)
```

#### 2. Sequential Chaining

```python
# Chain: Plan -> Research -> Write -> Evaluate
plan = await Runner.run(planner, task)
research = await Runner.run(researcher, plan.final_output)
content = await Runner.run(writer, research.final_output)
evaluation = await Runner.run(evaluator, content.final_output)
```

#### 3. Parallel Execution

```python
# Run multiple independent tasks in parallel
research_tasks = [
    research_task("Healthcare AI", "Research AI in healthcare"),
    research_task("Finance AI", "Research AI in finance"),
    research_task("Education AI", "Research AI in education")
]

results = await asyncio.gather(*research_tasks)
```

#### 4. Iterative Improvement

```python
# Keep improving until quality threshold is met
current_content = initial_content
for iteration in range(max_iterations):
    assessment = await Runner.run(evaluator, current_content)
    if assessment.quality_score >= threshold:
        break
    current_content = await Runner.run(improver, current_content)
```

## üîÄ Hybrid Orchestration (Best of Both Worlds)

### Overview

Hybrid orchestration intelligently combines LLM decision-making with code control, adapting the approach based on task characteristics for optimal results.

### Key Features

-   **Adaptive Strategy Selection**: Choose approach based on task analysis
-   **Phased Execution**: LLM planning + code execution + LLM synthesis
-   **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when primary strategy fails
-   **Dynamic Configuration**: Runtime modification of agent capabilities

### Example Architecture

```python
class HybridOrchestrator:
    async def orchestrate_task(self, task: str):
        # 1. Analyze task to determine best approach
        analysis = await self.analyze_task(task)

        # 2. Execute with optimal strategy
        if analysis.orchestration_strategy.mode == OrchestrationMode.LLM_DRIVEN:
            return await self.execute_llm_driven(task, analysis)
        elif analysis.orchestration_strategy.mode == OrchestrationMode.CODE_DRIVEN:
            return await self.execute_code_driven(task, analysis)
        else:  # HYBRID
            return await self.execute_hybrid(task, analysis)
```

## üéØ Orchestration Patterns Deep Dive

### Pattern 1: Autonomous Research System

**Use Case**: Complex research projects requiring multiple data sources and expertise

```python
# LLM autonomously plans research strategy
# Uses tools: web_search, file_search, code_execution
# Delegates to: writing_specialist, planning_specialist, data_analyst
```

### Pattern 2: Content Creation Pipeline

**Use Case**: Systematic content creation with quality control

```python
# Sequential chain: Planning -> Research -> Writing -> Quality Check
# Each step feeds into the next with structured handoffs
```

### Pattern 3: Parallel Processing System

**Use Case**: High-volume independent task processing

```python
# Multiple research agents working simultaneously
# Final synthesis of all results into comprehensive report
```

### Pattern 4: Iterative Quality Improvement

**Use Case**: Content that must meet specific quality standards

```python
# Writer creates content -> Evaluator assesses -> Writer improves
# Continues until quality threshold is met or max iterations reached
```

## üöÄ Best Practices
