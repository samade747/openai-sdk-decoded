# Phase 4: Expert Level - Module 4.5: Exception Handling

## üéØ Overview

This module focuses on robust exception handling strategies within the OpenAI Agents SDK. Proper error management is critical for building resilient, production-ready agentic systems that can gracefully handle unexpected situations, provide meaningful diagnostics, and recover from failures.

We will explore both the built-in exceptions provided by the SDK and best practices for defining and using custom exceptions tailored to complex agent workflows.

## üìö Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1.  **Understand the SDK's Exception Hierarchy**: Recognize the base `AgentsException` and its key derivatives like `MaxTurnsExceeded`, `ModelBehaviorError`, and `UserError`.
2.  **Implement Custom Exception Hierarchies**: Design and use custom exceptions that inherit from `AgentsException` to represent specific errors within your agent logic and workflows.
3.  **Handle SDK-Specific Exceptions**: Write code that effectively catches and responds to common exceptions raised by the Agents SDK during agent execution, tool use, and model interaction.
4.  **Manage Guardrail Exceptions**: Implement handlers for `InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered` and `OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered` to manage content safety and policy violations.
5.  **Improve Agent Reliability**: Develop agents that can identify, report, and potentially recover from errors, leading to more stable and trustworthy systems.
6.  **Debug and Diagnose Issues**: Utilize exception information, including custom error messages and context, to more effectively debug and diagnose problems in multi-agent systems.

## üîß Key Concepts & Technologies

-   **`agents.exceptions.AgentsException`**: The base class for all exceptions in the Agents SDK.
-   **`agents.exceptions.MaxTurnsExceeded`**: Raised when an agent exceeds its configured maximum number of execution turns.
-   **`agents.exceptions.ModelBehaviorError`**: Indicates unexpected behavior from the LLM, such as calling a non-existent tool or providing malformed JSON.
-   **`agents.exceptions.UserError`**: Signals incorrect usage of the SDK by the developer.
-   **`agents.exceptions.InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered`**: Raised when an input guardrail is triggered.
-   **`agents.exceptions.OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered`**: Raised when an output guardrail is triggered.
-   **Custom Exception Design**: Creating specific exception classes for domain-specific errors (e.g., `ToolExecutionError`, `StateManagementError`, `AgentCommunicationError`).
-   **`try-except` Blocks**: Standard Python mechanism for exception handling.
-   **Error Logging and Reporting**: Best practices for capturing and surfacing error information.
-   **Contextual Error Information**: Including relevant data within custom exceptions to aid debugging.

## üìù Examples Overview

-   **`01_custom_exceptions_hierarchy.py`**: Demonstrates defining a hierarchy of custom exceptions relevant to agentic workflows, inheriting from `AgentsException`. It will show how to raise and catch these specific exceptions.
-   **`02_sdk_exception_handling.py`**: Provides examples of handling common built-in exceptions from the OpenAI Agents SDK, such as `MaxTurnsExceeded`, `ModelBehaviorError`, and `UserError` in practical agent scenarios.
-   **`03_guardrail_exception_handling.py`**: Focuses on catching and processing exceptions related to guardrail violations, specifically `InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered` and `OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered`, and inspecting their results.

## üéì Next Steps

After mastering these exception handling patterns, you will be well-equipped to build more robust and fault-tolerant agentic applications. This knowledge is crucial for deploying agents in production environments where reliability is paramount.
