## 🔧 Key Technical Concepts

### RunResult Architecture

```python
# Core attributes
result.final_output      # Final response text
result.last_agent       # Agent that produced final response
result.new_items        # All items generated during execution
result.input           # Original input to the agent

# Conversation continuity
input_list = result.to_input_list()  # For next turn
```

### RunResultStreaming Architecture

```python
# Streaming execution
stream_result = Runner.run_streamed(agent, input)

# Event processing
async for event in stream_result.stream_events():
    if hasattr(event, 'text_delta') and event.text_delta:
        # Process text chunks
        pass

# Final access (after completion)
final_output = stream_result.final_output
```

### Performance Patterns

```python
# Memory-efficient streaming
async def process_stream_efficiently(stream_result):
    collected_text = ""
    async for event in stream_result.stream_events():
        if hasattr(event, 'text_delta') and event.text_delta:
            # Process immediately, don't store
            yield event.text_delta
            collected_text += event.text_delta
    return collected_text
```

### Error Handling Patterns

```python
# Robust streaming error handling
try:
    stream_result = Runner.run_streamed(agent, input)
    async for event in stream_result.stream_events():
        # Process events
        pass
except Exception as e:
    # Handle streaming errors
    logger.error(f"Streaming failed: {e}")
    # Fallback to regular execution
    result = await Runner.run(agent, input)
```

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Streaming Benefits

-   **Real-time feedback**: Users see responses as they're generated
-   **Perceived performance**: Lower time-to-first-byte
-   **Better UX**: Progressive disclosure of information

### Streaming Costs

-   **Complexity**: More complex error handling and state management
-   **Memory**: Event processing overhead
-   **Network**: Potential for more network overhead

### When to Use Streaming

-   ✅ Long responses (>2 seconds generation time)
-   ✅ Interactive applications requiring real-time feedback
-   ✅ Progressive data processing scenarios
-   ❌ Short, quick responses
-   ❌ Batch processing scenarios
-   ❌ Simple request-response patterns

## 🏗️ Production Patterns

### Monitoring and Observability

```python
# Comprehensive result monitoring
class ResultMonitor:
    def track_execution(self, result: RunResult):
        metrics = {
            'execution_time': self.calculate_time(result),
            'agent_transitions': self.count_handoffs(result),
            'tool_usage': self.analyze_tools(result),
            'memory_usage': self.measure_memory(result)
        }
        self.emit_metrics(metrics)
```

### Caching and Optimization

```python
# Result caching for performance
class ResultCache:
    def get_cached_result(self, input_hash: str) -> Optional[RunResult]:
        # Check cache for similar inputs
        pass

    def cache_result(self, input_hash: str, result: RunResult):
        # Cache successful results
        pass
```

### Security and Compliance

```python
# Secure result handling
class SecureResultHandler:
    def sanitize_result(self, result: RunResult) -> RunResult:
        # Remove sensitive information
        # Apply data governance policies
        pass

    def audit_result(self, result: RunResult):
        # Log for compliance
        pass
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing Results

```python
def test_result_attributes():
    result = await Runner.run(agent, "test input")
    assert result.final_output is not None
    assert result.last_agent.name == "expected_agent"
    assert len(result.new_items) > 0
```

### Integration Testing Streaming

```python
async def test_streaming_consistency():
    stream_result = Runner.run_streamed(agent, input)
    collected_text = ""

    async for event in stream_result.stream_events():
        if hasattr(event, 'text_delta'):
            collected_text += event.text_delta

    assert collected_text == stream_result.final_output
```

### Performance Testing

```python
async def test_streaming_performance():
    start_time = time.time()
    stream_result = Runner.run_streamed(agent, input)

    first_chunk_time = None
    async for event in stream_result.stream_events():
        if hasattr(event, 'text_delta') and first_chunk_time is None:
            first_chunk_time = time.time() - start_time
            break

    assert first_chunk_time < 1.0  # First chunk within 1 second
```
